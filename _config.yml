  desc: I work as a PhD student in the PANAMA team mainly on solving acoustic and audio signal processing inverse problems. From November 2015 I have been working on declipping and denoising using analysis/synthesis sparse priors. I also worked on sound source localization with massive regressions machine learning techniques.
